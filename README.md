Dimensional speech emotion recognition is a technique for analyzing and recognizing emotions in speech based on the dimensional model of emotion. Instead of categorizing emotions into discrete categories, this approach measures emotional states along continuous dimensions, typically valence, arousal, and dominance.
Valence: Valence describes the overall emotional positivity or negativity conveyed by the speech, indicating whether it evokes pleasant or unpleasant feelings.
Arousal: Arousal reflects the level of energy or activation present in the speech, indicating whether it elicits high excitement or low calmness.
Dominance: Dominance signifies the perceived level of control or influence expressed in the speech, indicating whether the speaker appears more authoritative or submissive.
